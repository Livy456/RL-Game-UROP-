# RL-Game-UROP-
This website is a computational tool that will help middle school students learn how the reward values for each state, 
and action pair affect the Q-learning process in Reinforcement learning through the medium of a car simulation game. 
Teaching reinforcement learning through a gamification approach to create extrinsic motivation to learn a new and challenging concept.
